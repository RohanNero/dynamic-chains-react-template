## Dynamic Chains React Template

ðŸ’­ This repo showcases a simple reusable header template for developing web3 apps with nextjs 13 app routing.

### Features

The header consists of

1. a custom rainbow connect button that allows the user to connect to a handful of different wallets with support for additional ones being relatively simple to add.
2. an option to display the user's address in the form of a QR code.
3. a button linking the user to the chain's block explorer.
4. an interactive dropdown menu containing a list of the apps supported chains that you can easily switch to by a single click.
5. a reactive balance component displaying the user's balance in terms of the chain's native token and in USD next to the currencies symbol.
